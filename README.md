# Articles recommendations with IBM

This project is a part of the Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

## 1. Project Description
In this project I analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, 
and build the Rank based recommendation, User-user collaborative filtering and SVD Matrix filtering in 
order to determine which articles to show to each user.

## 2. Installation
Clone or download the repository.

**Prerequisites**
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

For plotting:
- matplotlib

## 3. Summary:
The project contains the following sections:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Rank Based Recommendations: finds the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. 
- User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: looks at users similarity in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. 
- Matrix Factorization: builds a matrix decomposition using the user-item interactions, you will. Using the decomposition, I go the idea of how well I can predict new articles an individual might interact with.

## 4. Next step: 
To build Content Based Recommendations
